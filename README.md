
# Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching Projects and todo items.
A project can contain multiple todo items.
A TODO item is always associated to a project and can optionally have an attachment image.
Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created.

# Data model

Only one table is used to store both projects and todo items.
There are two common columns `hashK` and `rangeK` to store the hask, repectivly range keys for both types of objects.


## Projects
A project is uniquely identified through the combination of hash key and range key

- `hashK` (string) -  `user_name`
- `rangeK` (string) - `Project#project_created_at`
- `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an item was created
- `name` (string) - name of a project 
- `description` (string) - name of a project 

## TODOs
A todo item is uniquely identified through the combination of hash key and range key

- `hashK` (string) - contains `user_name#project_created_at`
- `rangeK` (string) - `Todo#todo_created_at`
- `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an item was created
- `name` (string) - name of a TODO item (e.g. "Change a light bulb")
- `dueDate` (string) - date and time by which an item should be completed
- `done` (boolean) - true if an item was completed, false otherwise
- `attachmentUrl` (string) (optional) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a TODO item

- <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/" target="_blank">Auth0 account</a>
- <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub account</a>
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> version up to 12.xx
- Serverless
  - Create a <a href="https://dashboard.serverless.com/" target="_blank">Serverless account</a> user
  - Install the Serverless Frameworkâ€™s CLI (up to VERSION=2.21.1). Refer to the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/" target="_blank">official documentation</a> for more help.

  ```
  - Login and configure serverless to use the AWS credentials
  ```bash
  # Login to your dashboard from the CLI. It will ask to open your browser and finish the process.
  serverless login
  # Configure serverless to use the AWS credentials to deploy the application
  # You need to have a pair of Access key (YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID and YOUR_SECRET_KEY) of an IAM user with Admin access permissions

# Functions 



- `Auth` - this function  implements a custom authorizer for API Gateway that should be added to all other functions.


- `GetProjects` - should return all the projects of the authenticated user. The default sort order is by createdAt descending (newest first).
The URL accepts an optional query parameter 'order' which in the current version of the implementation supports the value 'name'. In case this parameter is provided, the sort order is by project name ascending.

It should return data that looks like this:

```json
{
  "items": [
        "items": [
        {
            "hashK": "hWCgcxaHERRB8sHGVLz2vXCgVXKkflTw@clients",

# How to run the application

## Backend

To deploy an application run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

**Deploy a single function**

```
serverless deploy -f HandleImage # deploy a singe function
```


# Postman collection

An alternative way to test your API, you can use the Postman collection that contains sample requests. You can find a Postman collection in this project.
